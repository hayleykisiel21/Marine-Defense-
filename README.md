# Marine-Defense-

A social science model which visualizes the predator and prey enviroment based off of specific marine life defense mechanisms.

## Description

All animals have different ways to defend themselves, some using their strength and size and others using their unique skills. Using NetLogo, this model shows the emergence of marine life based off of sea animal defense mechanisms. The model enviroment consists of interactions between squid, octopi,  dolphins, and sharks, which each have their unique predator and prey mechanisms. For example, dolphins stay in groups to protect themselves from sharks while octopi find a hidden place to camoflauge themselves. Size parameters of each species can be modified in the intial enviroment in order to visualize the natural emergence of different types of enviroments.
